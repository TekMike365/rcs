# Rough Code Stack

Welcome to RCS — where code quality takes a backseat and debugging is an adventure! RCS is your go-to full-stack web development framework that’s as rough around the edges as your first project. Why use HTML and CSS when Python can do it all? Here, Python reigns supreme and code quality is barely a suggestion! Embrace the mess, enjoy unpredictability, and have fun as Python turns every line of code into a wild, whimsical escapade!
